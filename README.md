# Hello, I'm Richard 👋🏻

### A Brief Introduction

I'm a Royal Navy veteran looking to swap submarines for software development.

### Current Shenanigans

I'm a student at [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com) studying full-stack software development.

### In My Free Time

- #### Codewars

  ![Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/richardlambert/badges/small)

  A morally questionable amount of time is spent here wrestling with my [conscious incompetence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence) 🙌🏻👀.

- #### Personal Projects

  I always like to have a personal coding project cooking where I can apply what I'm learning and try new things. I'm currently working on [ais-tracker](https://github.com/richardIambert/ais-tracker), a web app that tracks real-time ship movements.

# Hello, I'm Richard 👋🏻

## A brief introduction

I'm an ex-Royal Navy Submariner currently enjoying a period of up/reskilling in the crazy world of software development.

## Current shenanigans and future goals

I'm a student at [Northcoders](https://northcoders.com) studying full-stack web development.

## In my free time

### Codewars

A morally questionable amount of time is spent here wrestling with my [conscious incompetence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_stages_of_competence) 🙌🏻👀.

### Personal projects

I always like to have a personal coding project cooking where I can apply what I'm learning and try new things. I'm currently working on an app called [ais-tracker](https://github.com/richardIambert/ais-tracker).
